<p> He began his music career in 2018 while hanging around other recording artists like Jay Gwuapo during their studio sessions, initially remixing popular songs within the New York City drill music scene, before embarking on creating original music. In a Genius interview, he stated that his artist name of Pop Smoke is a combination of Poppa (a nickname given to him by his Panamanian grandmother) and Smoke (part of a nickname given to him by childhood friends).

In early 2019, Pop Smoke released his debut single, “MPR”. This gained him buzz in the Brooklyn area. In January of 2019, he released “Flexing”, which received 100,000 views on YouTube within a day. Meanwhile, Pop Smoke befriended producer Rico Beats, who was acquainted with record executive Steven Victor. The three set up an interview, and in April 2019, Pop Smoke revealed that he signed to Victor Victor Worldwide, a subsidiary of Universal Music. In the same month, Pop Smoke released his breakout single, "Welcome to the Party", the lead single of his debut mixtape, Meet the Woo (2019) that was produced by 808Melo. The song was later remixed two times, one featuring Nicki Minaj and the other featuring Skepta in August 2019. The song was noted for its usage of UK drill production, later commonly seen throughout his discography. This was due to frequent collaborations with British drill producer 808Melo. Other well-known songs of his include: "Mpr", "Flexin'" and "Dior". Following the rise to popularity of "Welcome to the Party", he collaborated with other popular artists on singles such as: "War" featuring Lil Tjay and "100k on a Coupe" featuring Calboy. In December 2019, he collaborated on "Gatti" with JackBoys and Travis Scott, which is the last track on the JackBoys (2019) album by Scott and his Cactus Jack member.

According to authorities, four hooded men entered the home at about 4:30 AM on February 19; one of them wore a ski mask and carried a handgun. Police received news of the home invasion from a call from the East Coast. Police arrived at the home six minutes later and found Pop Smoke with multiple gunshot wounds. He was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. On February 21, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner revealed that the cause of Pop Smoke's death was a gunshot wound to the torso.

Pop Smoke was interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. On July 10, five men were arrested in connection with his murder. Four were charged with his murder: Corey Walker, 19, Keandre Rodgers, 18, and two teenagers, aged 17 and 15. Since the crime was committed during a robbery, the adults are eligible for the death penalty. A fifth person, 21-year-old Jaquan M was charged with attempted murder.
